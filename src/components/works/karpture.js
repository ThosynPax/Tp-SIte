          <div className="content">
            <p>You know those moments when you hit Ctrl + C like four times just to be sure it worked? Yeah, that‚Äôs me. Every single day.</p>
            <p>And the crazy part? I sometimes forget I already copied something important before smashing another Ctrl + C over it. Just like that, gone!</p>
            <p>So instead of whining about it again for the hundredth time, I did what any developer who‚Äôs fed up would do: I built something.</p>
            <p>That‚Äôs how Karpture was born.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section className="section">
          <h2 className="subtitle">I Started with What I know</h2>
          <div className="content">
            <p>I didn‚Äôt open 10 tabs looking for a ‚Äúperfect tech stack.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt try to overthink it. I just asked myself: ‚ÄúWhat do I already know that‚Äôs enough to get this done?‚Äù</p>
            <p>The answer? HTML. CSS. JS. And of course, the good ol‚Äô manifest.json.</p>
            <p>The first actual task wasn‚Äôt even about writing code. It was just:
              <br /><br /><em>git init</em>
              <br /><em>npm init</em>
            </p>
            <p>Starting a Git repo felt like a warm-up lap before the real sprint. And trust me, there‚Äôs a kind of magic in that. Once the repo was alive, the project started breathing.</p>

          <h2 className="subtitle">Break it Down or Burn Out</h2>
          <div className="content">
            <p>One of the smartest things I did? I broke the entire build down into the tiniest possible pieces:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each file I needed to create</li>
              <li>Each little function I needed to write</li>
              <li>Each folder that needed to exist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It wasn‚Äôt about trying to finish the app in one sitting. It was about giving every file its own day or its own moment.</p>
            <p>By Day 3, I was deep into fixing my event listener for copy actions. By Day 5, I had the clipboard data storing properly in localStorage.</p>
            <p>It wasn‚Äôt about building fast. It was about building without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

          <h2 className="subtitle">Forget Beautiful. Make it Work First.</h2>
          <div className="content">
            <p>If I had opened Figma on Day 1, I‚Äôd probably still be stuck designing the logo üòÖ</p>
            <p>Instead, I ignored all that. I didn‚Äôt care if it looked ugly, because beauty doesn‚Äôt fix bugs. I only had one goal: Make it functional first. Pretty can come later.</p>
            <p>A functional app, no matter how simple or ugly, is 1000x better than a beautiful prototype that never ships.</p>

          <h2 className="subtitle">It‚Äôs Just Version 1, And That‚Äôs Okay</h2>
          <div className="content">
            <p>Karpture wasn‚Äôt built to be a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù app. It was built to solve one specific problem.</p>
            <p>Sure, I‚Äôve got ideas for version 2, better UX, cloud sync, maybe even an AI assistant to auto-label copied items. But for now? It does what I need. And that‚Äôs a win.</p>
            <p>Fun twist? I facilitated a QA class on Scrum and Agile around the same time and used Karpture as our case study. We treated it like a mini-sprint project. The best part? The students renamed it! It was initially called ClipKip, but after some brainstorming, they came up with Karpture, and it stuck.</p>
            <p>I even added them as contributors for the v1.0.1 release on<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/clipkip?launch=karpture" target='_blank'>Product Hunt.</a> Now, it‚Äôs live on the Chrome Web Store as a proper extension. We‚Äôre already planning what comes next.</p>

            ‚ÄúKarpture isn‚Äôt fancy. But it works. It was born out of a need. It‚Äôs simple, and I plan to improve it. But version 1 is out there, nd that‚Äôs what matters.‚Äù

          <h2 className="subtitle">Why Build Like This?</h2>
          <div className="content">
            <p>You move faster. You actually ship. You get real feedback early. You avoid burnout from chasing perfection. You know what to fix instead of guessing.</p>
            <p>If you‚Äôve been thinking of building something too, just start. Not everything has to be a full-blown startup or a viral product. Sometimes, building that one thing that solves your personal pain point is all the push you need.</p>
            <p>Don‚Äôt start with Figma. Don‚Äôt waste 2 months writing the perfect PRD. Don‚Äôt overthink the UI.</p>
            <p>Start by solving one clear problem. Ship something basic, something functional. Let your first version look like it was built in a weekend (because maybe it was).</p>
            <p>Truth is, if you wait until it‚Äôs perfect, you‚Äôll either get stuck or quit.</p>
